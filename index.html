<p>Apple cofounder and former CEO Steve Jobs has a tremendous legacy.</p>
<p>He's remembered for his obsessive commitment to quality (sometimes to the point of ruthlessness ), incredible success, and vision.</p>
</div>
<p class="text-style">Some facts about Steve Jobs:</p>
<div class="fact-style">
<ul>
<li>Steve Jobs was adopted shortly after being born.</li>
<li>Jobs was, biologically, half Arab. His biological father was Syrian and his mother was American.</li>
<li>Jobs's biological parents had one mandate--that Jobs be adopted by two college-educated people. The biological parents found out that neither Clara nor Paul Jobs had ever graduated from college, but the adoption went through when it was promised that Steve Jobs would receive a university education (funny considering that Jobs went on to become a college dropout).</li>
<li>Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak met in high school--Wozniak was 18 and Jobs was just 13.</li>
<li>He was an official college dropout, but continued his education by informally auditing classes.</li>
<li>One class Jobs audited was a calligraphy course, which he says was instrumental in the future Apple products' attention to typography and font.</li>
<li>While unofficially attending classes, Jobs struggled to get by. He slept on his friends' dorm room floors, returned Coke bottles for money, and survived off free meals from the local Hare Krishna temple.</li>
<li>He had a pretty low GPA--just 2.65. Jobs admitted he never enjoyed school structure and preferred to learn in unconventional ways.</li>
<li>He spent seven months traveling around India, experimenting with psychedelic drugs and eventually adopting the practices of Zen Buddhism.</li>
<li>Jobs stole from partner and co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak. When the pair first created the Breakout game for Atari, they planned on splitting the pay 50-50. Although Atari gave Jobs $5,000 for the game, Jobs told Wozniak they got $700, leaving Wozniak to take home $350 while Jobs pocketed the other $4,650.</li>
<li>Jobs was moved to the night shift when working at Atari due to complaints about his hygiene. He rarely showered and would walk around barefoot in the Atari offices.</li>
<li>The original Apple I computer was priced at $666.66. Don't worry, there was no devil worshipping going on--Jobs and Wozniak just wanted the Apple I to cost one-third more than wholesale ($500).</li>
<li>Jobs was pushed out of his own company in 1985. Despite the fallout, he later recognized the coup as a blessing in disguise, as it gave him a chance to experiment creatively and purchase an animation studio, which would later be known as Pixar. Eventually he rejoined Apple as CEO in 1997 (and revitalized the failing company).</li>
<li>Shortly after being shooed out of Apple, Jobs applied to fly on the Space Shuttle as a civilian astronaut (he was rejected) and even considered starting a computer company in the Soviet Union.</li>
<li>Jobs had an illegitimate child, Lisa Brennan, when he was 23, whose paternity he denied for years. Lisa's mother had to use welfare checks to raise her child. Eventually, Jobs did accept Lisa as his legitimate child, and she changed her name to Lisa Brennan-Jobs.</li>
<li>Despite initially denying paternity, around the time Lisa was born, Jobs named a new Apple computer the Apple Lisa (although Jobs claimed it simply stood for Local Integrated Software Architecture).</li>
<li>Jobs ended up connecting later in life with his biological sister, Mona Simpson, whom he grew very close with. Both were naturally artistic and shared much in common.</li>
<li>The movie Anywhere But Here is based on a book written by Jobs's sister, Mona Simpson. The movie is dedicated to Jobs.</li>
<li>Jobs was no philanthropist. In fact, in Apple's early days, he cut the company's philanthropic programs, saying they would return when the company was more profitable. Despite Apple's enormous success, the charitable programs were never reinstated.</li>
<li>Jobs had an entire team devoted to packaging who studied the experience of opening a box to learn how to achieve the excitement and emotional response that is now common with Apple products.</li>
<li>A well-known egomaniac, Jobs was infamous for being difficult and demanding. In 1993, he held a spot on Fortune's list of America's Toughest Bosses.</li>
<li>Jobs is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor for 346 United States patents related to a range of technologies, with most of the patents being for design.</li>
<li>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak notes that Jobs never learned how to code.</li>
<li>Apple has been ranked No. 1 on Fortune's list of America's most admired companies.</li>
<li>Jobs originally did not want to offer his products in white, but he was swayed after being introduced to the "moon gray" shade. Pretty surprising considering the iconic clean, white look of Apple products today.</li>
<li>Jobs actually served as a mentor for Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, even sharing some of his advisers with the Google duo.</li>
<li>Jobs was furious when Google created its Android devices, entering as an Apple competitor in the phone market.</li>
<li>Jobs was found to have pancreatic cancer in 2003, but rather than taking the doctor-recommended path of immediate operation, Jobs subscribed to an alternative-medicine regimen, including a vegan diet, acupuncture, and herbal remedies, even consulting a psychic.</li>
<li>After nine months, Jobs gave in and underwent surgery. Many consider the delay a major factor in his eventual decline.</li>
<li>Apple, Microsoft, and Disney properties (including Disneyland and Disney World) flew their flags at half-staff when Jobs died.</li>
<li>His last words on his deathbed were, "Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow," while gazing over his family's shoulders.</li>
<li>Tim Cook revealed in a 2014 interview that Jobs's main office and nameplate are still as they were in 2011, when Jobs passed away.</li>
<li>Sunday, October 16, 2011, was declared Steve Jobs Day by the governor of California, Jerry Brown.</li>
